# **3\. The Market Opportunity: Rawalpindiâ€™s Next Landmark** {#3.-the-market-opportunity:-rawalpindiâ€™s-next-landmark}

## **3.1 Market Opportunity Overview** {#3.1-market-opportunity-overview}

Rawalpindi is one of Pakistanâ€™s fastest-growing urban areas, benefitting from significant investments in infrastructure and real estate development, especially in high-demand areas like Bahria Town Phase 8\. With rapid urbanisation, increasing population growth, and a rise in disposable incomes, the demand for high-end residential and commercial properties is on the rise. As a result, real estate investors are increasingly turning their attention to mixed-use projects that combine luxury living with commercial utilityâ€”making Elements Residencia a prime opportunity.

### **3.1 (a) Rawalpindi District Population Growth (2024-2028)**

Between 2024 and 2028, the population of Rawalpindi District is projected to grow at an annual rate of 2.1%, outpacing many other districts in Punjab. This growth is driven by:

* Urbanisation: A continuous influx of people from rural areas and other cities looking for better employment and living standards.  
* Young Demographic: Approximately 65% of Rawalpindi's population falls within the working-age bracket (15-64 years), fueling demand for residential and commercial units.

Given that Bahria Town Phase 8 is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the city, Elements Residencia is strategically positioned to cater to this growing population. The need for both high-end residential units and flexible commercial spaces is increasing, offering potential for both capital appreciation and rental income.

### **3.1 (b) Housing Ownership Trends (2024-2028)**

According to data from Pakistan's Census Bureau, housing ownership is expected to shift toward vertical developments as land in premium areas becomes scarce. The demand for luxury apartments is anticipated to grow by 12% annually between 2024 and 2028, particularly among:

* Overseas Pakistanis seeking secure, modern properties to invest in.  
* Young professionals and dual-income families who prefer secure, serviced apartment living over traditional homeownership.

With Elements Residencia offering fully furnished, serviced apartments through its partnership with Roomy, it caters directly to this trend of increasing demand for premium, serviced residential units. Investors stand to benefit from the growing preference for hassle-free apartment ownership and property management.

### **3.1 (c) Key Economic Metrics (2024-2028)**

The macroeconomic landscape in Pakistan is forecast to show resilience, with key metrics relevant to real estate investment:

* GDP Growth: Pakistanâ€™s GDP is expected to grow at an average rate of 4-4.5% annually, providing a stable economic backdrop for real estate investment.  
* Inflation Rates: Inflation is expected to stabilise between 7-9% over the next five years, ensuring that property values keep pace with economic growth and continue to rise.  
* Interest Rates: Lower interest rates are making borrowing more affordable, encouraging investment in real estate and infrastructure projects.

These economic metrics indicate a promising environment for real estate investments, especially in high-demand areas like Bahria Town, where premium projects like Elements Residencia are set to thrive.

## **3.2 Competitive Analysis: Elements Residencia vs. Other Projects**

To position Elements Residencia as a superior investment option, a detailed comparison with similar projects in the Rawalpindi and Islamabad areas will highlight its advantages.

| Project Name | Location | Developed By | Price (PKR/sqft) | Yearly Rent (PKR/sqft) | Key Features |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Safari Villas Apartments | Bahria Town Phase 7, Rawalpindi | Bahria Town Developers | 16,500 | 1237 | Family-oriented, parks, green spaces, gated community, basic commercial facilities. |

| Bahria Heights | Bahria Town Phase 4, Rawalpindi | Bahria Town Developers | 17,500 | 1200 | High-rise residential, good community services, access to nearby commercial centres. |

Comparative data suggests that fully furnished buildings in Rawalpindi estimates the ***rental rate to PKR 1250 per sqft in a year as of 2024**.* Considering that ***rental agreements are incremented 10% yearly*** and in the context of 2026, when Elements Residencia launches in the market***, the rental rates will be estimated to PKR 1512 per sqft in 2026***. Considering the price for Elements Residencia, which is PKR 17,000 per sqft, the rental ROI for Elements Residencia upon completion will be the following. Optimistic estimates are calculated based on 2026 forecasted rental rate while conservative estimates are based on the condition that the rental trend will not increase in the future (highly unlikely):

* **Optimistic Yearly Rental ROI : \~ 8.89%**  
* **Conservative Yearly Rental ROI : \~ 7.35%**

## **4.2 (a) Valuation of Elements Residencia in 2024\.**

### **i). Comparison Method**

Recent sales in Bahria Town and DHA averages PKR 22,500 per sqft. Elements Residenciaâ€™s' premium location and partnership with Roomy.pk raises its value to **PKR 25,000 per sqft.**

### **ii). Rental Evaluation Method**

This method estimates the asset's value based on its current rental income. It is simple yet effective in providing an accurate valuation. Understanding key terms is essential for evaluating a propertyâ€™s worth.

 ROI \=Annual Rental Income Estimated Market Value  
or  
 Estimated Market Value \=Annual Rental IncomeROI

**Market Rental Income:** Recent analysis shows that rent for a luxury mixed-use apartment building in Bahria Town is PKR 1,250 and offers an ROI of 5% yearly in terms of rent.

* **Using 5%** as Cap Rate**:** (1,250/0.05 \= **PKR 25,000 / sqft**)

### **iii). Replacement Cost Method**

This method estimates the value of an asset based on the investment contributed in the creation of the asset. This is a conservative estimate to understand the underlying value of an asset.

| Itineraries | PKR | PKR/sqft |
| ----- | ----- | :---: |
| Land Cost | 600,000,000 | 962 |
| Construction Cost | 8,000,000,000 | 12,821 |
| Mechanical Cost | 1,500,000,000 | 2,404 |
| OverHeads | 1,515,000,000 | 2,428 |
| Total | 11,615,000,000 | 18,614 |
| **Total Cost (Incl. Cost of equity)** | **13,357,250,000** | **21,406** |

Project Costing through this assessment, the deduced price for a sq ft of Elements Residencia is **PKR 21,406 per sqft.**

### 

## **4.2 (b). (Forecasted) Valuation of Elements Residencia in 2026\.**

### **i). Compounded Growth Method**

The Compounded Growth Evaluation Method estimates an asset's future value by applying a constant growth rate over time, based on compound interest. It is commonly used in real estate and investment analysis to project property appreciation using historical or expected growth rates in an economy.  
Key elements of this method include:

* Inflation Rate: Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises. Data from PBS suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2023 has been approximately 8.5% per year in Pakistan  
* GDP Growth Rate: It is a broad indicator of economic health and expansion. In the context of this method, the GDP growth rate gives insight into how the overall economy is growing, influencing the expected growth rate of the asset. Data from PBS suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2023 has been approximately 4.0% per year in Pakistan  
* Compounded Growth Rate: **12.5%** Inflation Rate \+ GDP Growth

**Using all methods with Compounded Growth to determine the Value in 2026\.**

The compounded growth for 2 years would be 1.265. When applied to the valuations determined for Elements Residencia in 2024, this growth rate could give a glimpse of what to expect for price in 2028\.

| Valuation Method | Cost in 2024 | CGF | Value in 2028 |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| i). Comparison Method | 25,000 | 1.6 | 31,640 |
| ii). Rental Evaluation Method | 25,000 | 1.6 | 31,640 |
| iii). Replacement Cost Method | 21,406 | 1.6 | 27,100 |

### **ii). Future Rental Evaluation**

Similarly, the rental evaluation can be used to evaluate a propertyâ€™s worth based on its future expected rental yield.

In Pakistan, statistically the rent increases per year at the rate of 10% approximately. The table below shows the incremental progression of rent.


| Project | Rent (2024) | Rent (2025) | Rent (2026) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Grande Apartments (Phase 3\) | 1250 | 1375 | 1512.5 |
| Safari Villas Apartments | 1237 | 1360.7 | 1496.77 |
| Spring Arch | 1300 | 1430 | 1573 |
| Bahria Heights (Phase 8\) | 1200 | 1320 | 1452 |

**Market Rental Income:** This analysis shows that rent for a luxury mixed-use apartment building in Bahria Phase 7 would be PKR 1500 by 2026\. 

* **Using 5%** as Cap Rate**:** (1500/0.05 \= **PKR 30,000 / sqft**)

## **4.4 Risk Factors** 

The following table outlines the key risks associated with the project and the corresponding mitigation strategies to ensure smooth execution and investor protection.

| Risk | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Construction Risk | Rising material costs or delays in construction due to weather, labour, or supply chain issues. | Milestone-based funding adjusts pricing as construction progresses; costs are spread across future salesâ€‹. |
| Capital Market Risk | Rising interest rates or changing investor preferences affecting financing or demand. | Secure early financing, front-load costs to future rounds, and offer competitive returnsâ€‹. |

# **6\. Investment Structure and Tokenization Model** {#6.-investment-structure-and-tokenization-model}

## **6.1 Traditional Real Estate: High Barriers, High Risk** {#6.1-traditional-real-estate:-high-barriers,-high-risk}

Historically, real estate investmentâ€”especially hotel luxury projects like *Elements Residencia*â€”has been restricted to high-net-worth individuals or institutional investors due to the high capital required. In traditional models, investors must purchase entire units, which limits flexibility and accessibility. Additionally, challenges such as construction delays, market volatility, and illiquidity increase the risk and complexity, keeping smaller investors at bay. These barriers prevent broader participation in what is typically a lucrative asset class.

## **6.2 How Tokenization Empowers You** {#6.2-how-tokenization-empowers-you}

Tokenization addresses these historical barriers by breaking real estate into digital tokens. In *Elements Residencia*, ownership of the project is divided into tokens, each representing 1 square foot of the project. These tokens allow investors to participate in high-value real estate at a fraction of the cost required for traditional ownership. By leveraging blockchain technology, tokenization offers:

* **Transparency**: Every transaction is securely recorded on an immutable blockchain ledger.  
* **Security**: The decentralised nature of blockchain protects against fraud and tampering.  
* **Liquidity**: Tokens can be traded on secondary markets, allowing for easier exit strategies compared to traditional real estate, which can take months or years to sell.

In *Elements Residencia*, token holders benefit from both capital appreciation and passive income through profits made on hotel serviced apartments powered by Roomy, making it an ideal solution for investors seeking flexible and transparent ownership.

## **6.3 Developmental Real Estate: A High-Reward Opportunity** {#6.3-developmental-real-estate:-a-high-reward-opportunity}

*Elements Residencia* offers a unique opportunity for investors to gain exposure to one of Rawalpindiâ€™s most promising and luxurious developmental hotel projects. The high-growth potential of the property, combined with tokenization, provides multiple avenues for returns:

* **Early-Stage Access**: Investors can enter at early stages with tokens priced competitively at PKR 17,000 per square foot, with token value expected to appreciate significantly as the project nears completion and establishes itself as a hotel destination.  
* **Capital Appreciation**: Tokens purchased in the initial rounds are expected to grow by **30-40%** by the time the project is fully operational, driven by rising real estate prices in Bahria Town and Rawalpindi and tourist appeal.  
* **Mitigated Risk**: Investors can access tokenized ownership without the need for large upfront capital, reducing the risk exposure typically associated with traditional developmental real estate.

## **6.4 Tokenization Framework** {#6.4-tokenization-framework}

### **6.4 (a) Property Rights and Asset Classification** {#6.4-(a)-property-rights-and-asset-classification}

*Elements Residencia* tokens represent either **demarcated** or **non-demarcated** property rights. Investors can choose between:

* **Demarcated Area**: Ownership tied to a specific, clearly defined unit such as a 1-bedroom apartment, a hotel suite, or a commercial space within the property.  
* **Non-Demarcated Area**: Ownership fractionalized across the entire property, without a specific unit assigned. Non-demarcated tokens are flexible and easily tradable across the secondary market.

| Aspect | Demarcated Area | Non-Demarcated Area |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Investment Size** | Requires larger upfront capital for full unit ownership. | Allows smaller investments via tokens. |
| **Liquidity** | Low liquidity; must sell the entire unit. | High liquidity; tokens are easily tradable. |
| **Flexibility** | Tied to a specific unit, limiting trading options. | Tokens are flexible and easily tradable like digital assets. |
| **Tradability** | Difficult; legal transfer of the entire unit is required. | Highly tradable like stocks. |
| **Ownership** | Exclusive ownership of a specific unit. | Tokenized ownership across the property. |
| **Suitability** | Ideal for long-term control of a specific unit. | Perfect for investors seeking liquidity and flexibility. |

This dual model provides flexibility for investors, whether they seek to own specific units or prefer more liquid, partial ownership.

### **6.4 (b) The Asset and Token Structure** {#6.4-(b)-the-asset-and-token-structure}

Each token in *Elements Residencia* represents 1 square foot of the property, offering an affordable and flexible entry point into real estate investment. Here are the key attributes of the token structure:

| Attribute | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Token Definition** | A digital representation of property rights. |
| **Token Representation** | 1 token represents 1 square foot in Elements Residencia |
| **Storage** | Tokens are securely stored in a central wallet. |
| **Ownership Type** | Tokenized ownership of the property. |
| **Transferability** | Easily transferable or tradable on blockchain platforms. |

### **6.4 (c) Token to NFT Process Flow** {#6.4-(c)-token-to-nft-process-flow}

The process of converting tokens into NFTs in *Elements Residencia* is designed to give investors flexibility in ownership. Hereâ€™s how the process works:

1. **Token Ownership**: Investors purchase tokens representing a Tokenized share of *Elements Residencia*.  
2. **Conversion to NFT**: Upon project completion, tokens can be converted into NFTs that represent specific units (e.g., apartments or offices). Investors must own enough tokens to cover the square footage of the desired unit for NFT conversion.  
3. **Burning Tokens**: Once tokens are converted into an NFT, the tokens are burned, removing them from circulation.  
4. **NFT Ownership**: The NFT grants exclusive ownership of a specific unit, which can be sold or leased like traditional real estate.

The **NFT conversion process** ensures that investors who want exclusive ownership of a physical unit can transition seamlessly from Tokenized to full ownership.

### **6.4 (d) Why Burn Tokens?** {#6.4-(d)-why-burn-tokens?}

* **Prevent Duplication**: Once tokens are converted to NFTs, burning ensures that the original tokens cannot be duplicated or reused.  
* **Enforce Uniqueness**: NFTs are non-fungible, ensuring the unit represented by the NFT remains unique.  
* **Preserve Asset Integrity**: Burning tokens ensures the integrity of the token supply, preventing over-inflation of ownership shares.

## **6.5 Token and NFT Utilities** {#6.5-token-and-nft-utilities}

Owning tokens in *Elements Residencia* unlocks a range of benefits:

* **Co-Ownership of Prime Real Estate**: Token holders own a share of one of Rawalpindiâ€™s most exclusive properties. Even without a specific unit, investors share in the success of the entire development.  
* **Profit Potential**: As property values increase, token holders benefit from capital appreciation. Upon completion, token values are projected to rise by **30-40%** from their initial purchase price.  
* **Passive Income**: Once *Elements Residencia* becomes operational, token holders will receive passive income from rental yields or business dividends generated from the commercial spaces and the roomy hotel.  
* **Asset Ownership for NFT Holders**: After converting tokens to NFTs, owners gain full control over specific units (e.g., apartments or offices), allowing them to lease, sell, or occupy the space.  
* **Security and Peace of Mind**: NFTs represent real property ownership, backed by legal documentation. This provides peace of mind and the ability to legally enforce property rights.  
* **Investor Voting & Governance**: Token holders gain voting rights to influence key decisions related to project development, property management, and strategic direction.

## **8.1 Role of Blockchain for Transparency and Security** {#8.1-role-of-blockchain-for-transparency-and-security}

Elements Residencia utilises **blockchain technology** to ensure complete transparency and security for investors.

This enhances **trust and visibility** while reducing fraud risk, giving investors a clear view of the project's progress and area distribution.

## **8.2 Smart Contracts for Ownership and area release for sale** {#8.2-smart-contracts-for-ownership-and-area-release-for-sale}

## **10.1 Securities and exchange commission Pakistan \- SECP** {#10.1-securities-and-exchange-commission-pakistan---secp}

Elements Residencia operates as a **private limited company**, established as a **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)** and registered with the **Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP)**.

By isolating financial risks, Elements Residencia offers stakeholders a secure and transparent investment environment.

## **10.2 Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)** {#10.2-special-purpose-vehicle-(spv)}

**SPV Ring-Fencing** is a legal and financial structure designed to isolate and safeguard the assets and liabilities of a specific project from the broader operations of the parent company.

**Key Elements of SPV Ring-Fencing:**

* **Isolating Risk**: The SPVâ€™s assets and liabilities are legally separated from the parent company, protecting the parent from any issues within the SPV.
