### **4.2 (a). Valuation Methods** {#4.2-(a).-valuation-methods}

**I. Comparison Method:**  
The Comparison Method of valuation assesses property value based on recent sales of similar properties in comparable locations, offering a market-driven estimate for investment decisions. Recent property sales in high-demand areas like DHA and similar premium communities underscore the value of prime locations. Amna Homes’ strategic position within DHA Bahawalpur, coupled with its superior construction quality and comprehensive community amenities, contributes to a strong foundation for value appreciation. With key strategic partnerships enhancing its appeal, Amna Homes is anticipated to show steady growth over the coming years, making it an attractive long-term asset for investors  
**II. Rental Evaluation Method:**  
This method estimates the asset's value based on its current rental income. It is simple yet effective in providing an accurate valuation. Understanding key terms is essential for evaluating a property’s worth.

 ROI \=Annual Rental Income Estimated Market Value  
or  
 Estimated Market Value \=Annual Rental IncomeROI

**Market Rental ROI %:** Recent analysis shows that rental ROI for residential spaces in high-demand areas like DHA can vary significantly. For Amna Homes, with its attractive rate of PKR 9,200 per sq. ft. and a rental yield of approximately 2%, this reflects a conservative yet stable income potential. Given this rate, Amna Homes offers an appealing entry price for investors while providing consistent returns within a secure, high-quality residential community.  
**Using 2%** as Cap Rate**:** (184/0.02 \= **PKR 9,200 / sqft**)

**III. Replacement Cost Method:**  
This method estimates the value of an asset based on the investment contributed in the creation of the asset in the present time. This is a conservative estimate to understand the underlying value of an asset.

| Itineraries | PKR | PKR/sqft |
| ----- | :---: | :---: |
| Land acquisition and related cost | 1,300,000,000 | 1,429 |
| Developmental charges | 430,000,000 | 473 |
| Design & Approval | 227,500,000 | 250 |
| Construction cost | 4,368,000,000 | 4,800 |
| Mechanical & HVAC | 1,501,500,000 | 1,650 |
| Overheads | 1,547,000,000 | 1,700 |
| **Total Cost** | **9,374,000,000** | **10,301** |

Project Costing through this assessment, the deduced price for a sq ft of Amna Homes Realty is **PKR 10,301 per sqft.**

### **4.2 (b). Forecasted Valuation of Amna Homes in 2026** {#4.2-(b).-forecasted-valuation-of-amna-homes-in-2026}

**I. Compounded Growth Method:**  
The Compounded Growth Evaluation Method estimates an asset's future value by applying a constant growth rate over time, based on compound interest. It is commonly used in real estate and investment analysis to project property appreciation using historical or expected growth rates in an economy.  
Key elements of this method include:

* **Inflation Rate:** Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises. Data from PBS and SBP suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2024 has remained on average 10% per year in Pakistan  
* **GDP Growth Rate:** It is a broad indicator of economic health and expansion. In the context of this method, the GDP growth rate gives insight into how the overall economy is growing, influencing the expected growth rate of the asset. Data from PBS suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2024 has been approximately 4% per year in Pakistan  
* **Compounded Growth Rate:** **14.5%** Inflation Rate \+ GDP Growth

**Using all methods with Compounded Growth to determine the Value in 2026\.**  
The compounded growth for 2 years would be 14.5%. When applied to the valuations determined for Qube in 2024, this growth rate could give a glimpse of what to expect for price in 2026\.

## 

| Valuation Method | Cost in 2024 | CGF | Value in 2026 |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| i). Comparison Method | 9,200 | 14.50% | 12,061 |
| ii). Rental Evaluation Method | 9,200 | 10.00% | 11,132 |
| iii). Replacement Cost Method | 10,300 | 12.00% | 12,920 |

## 

**II. Future Rental Evaluation Method:**

Similarly, the **rental evaluation method** assesses a property’s value based on future rental yield. In Pakistan, rents typically increase by **10% annually** due to inflation and growing demand. This method helps investors predict future property value and potential returns, offering a clearer view of long-term profitability.

## 

M**arket Rental Income:** Analysis indicates that rental rates for luxury villas in DHA Bahawalpur are expected to reach PKR 280 per month by 2027\.

* **Using 2%** as Cap Rate**:** (280/0.02 \= **PKR 14,000 / sqft**)

# **6\. Investment Structure and Tokenization Model** {#6.-investment-structure-and-tokenization-model}

## **6.1 Traditional Real Estate: High Barriers, High Risk** {#6.1-traditional-real-estate:-high-barriers,-high-risk}

Historically, real estate—especially large-scale development projects—has been perceived as inaccessible to the average investor. **High capital requirements** often restrict participation to wealthy individuals or institutional investors. Additionally, **risks** such as *construction delays*, *market fluctuations*, and the **inherent illiquidity** of real estate have created a challenging landscape. *A lack of transparency* in many deals further contributes to uncertainty, leaving smaller investors hesitant to participate. As a result, **traditional real estate investment** has largely remained a **high-stakes venture** for those with substantial financial resources.

## **6.2 How Tokenization Empowers You?** {#6.2-how-tokenization-empowers-you?}

## **6.3 Developmental Real Estate: A High-Reward Opportunity** {#6.3-developmental-real-estate:-a-high-reward-opportunity}

Developmental real estate offers a unique opportunity for **exponential growth**, and now, thanks to tokenization, you can access these **lucrative projects** without the typical capital burden. **Tokenized real estate** enables *flexible investments*, granting you the potential to benefit from *capital appreciation* while enjoying enhanced *transparency* and lower risk. *Early-stage investment* in development projects not only grants **ownership** but also opens the door to **high-reward opportunities** with significantly **mitigated risks**.

## **6.4 Tokenization Framework**   {#6.4-tokenization-framework}

Through DAO PropTech’s platform, investors can purchase tokens in Amna Homes. **Tokenization is a digital representation of property rights**, allowing partial ownership by converting the property into tradable digital tokens. This provides investors with an affordable and flexible way to own a portion of the property without large upfront capital.

Below is the structure of the tokenization model used for Amna Homes:

### **6.4 (a). Property rights and asset classification.** {#6.4-(a).-property-rights-and-asset-classification.}

The total area of Amna Homes is divided into two categories.  
**I. Demarcated:** Ownership is tied to a specific, clearly defined unit (e.g., apartment, office) within a property, offering exclusive control over that unit.  
**II. Non-Demarcated:** Ownership is partial across the entire property, without a specific unit assigned, making the asset homogeneous, flexible, and easily tradable.

To understand how ownership rights and area-holder rights are accommodated, familiarity with the following terms is essential:

| Aspect | 1). Demarcated Area | 2). Non-Demarcated Area |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Investment Size | Requires large upfront capital to purchase a full unit. | Allows smaller investments to be partially owned by purchasing tokens. |
| Liquidity | Low liquidity; the entire unit must be sold or transferred. | High liquidity; tokens can be traded like stocks on the secondary market. |
| Flexibility | Limited; tied to a specific unit, difficult to trade or divide. | Easily tradable; tokens function as homogeneous digital assets. |
| Tradability | Difficult to trade; ownership tied to physical assets and legal transfer processes. | Homogeneous and tradable like other digital assets (tokens). |
| Ownership | Ownership of a specific, clearly defined unit (e.g., apartment, hotel apartment, office). | Partial ownership of the entire property, without a specific unit. |
| Suitability | Best for those seeking long-term control and use of a specific property. | Ideal for investors seeking liquidity, flexibility, and ease of trading. |

### 

### **6.4 (b). The Asset and Token Structure :**  {#6.4-(b).-the-asset-and-token-structure-:}

**I. Definitions:**

| Attribute | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| Token Definition | A digital representation of property rights, providing partial ownership of the property. |
| Token Representation | Each token represents 1 square foot of the building. |
| Storage | Tokens are securely stored in a central wallet. |
| Ownership Type | Partial ownership of the property. |
| Transferability | Tokens can be easily transferred or traded. |

### **6.4 (c). Tokenization Framework** {#6.4-(c).-tokenization-framework}

**I. Token-to-NFT Process Flow**

* **Token Ownership**: Investors purchase tokens representing partial ownership of the property.  
* **Conversion to NFT**: Tokens can be converted into NFTs representing specific units (e.g., apartments) once the project is completed.  
* **Burning Tokens**: Tokens are burned during conversion, removing them from circulation permanently.  
* **NFT Ownership**: NFTs grant exclusive ownership of a specific unit and can be traded or sold like traditional real estate but in a digital format.

**II. Why Burn Tokens?**

* **Prevent Duplication**: Burning the tokens ensures that they can't be used again or sold while the new NFT exists.  
* **Enforce Uniqueness**: NFTs are unique, non-fungible assets, so burning the original tokens ensures that only the NFT remains to represent the property.  
* **Preserve Integrity**: It prevents the inflation of ownership and maintains the integrity of the total asset supply.

## 

## **6.5. Token and NFT Utilities:** {#6.5.-token-and-nft-utilities:}

**Owning tokens** in Amna Homes unlocks a wealth of opportunities, including:

* **Co-Ownership of Prime Real Estate:** As a token holder, you’ll own a portion of one of the most sought-after high-end properties. Even without a specific unit tied to your name, you’ll share in the success of the entire property.  
* **Profit Potential:** Once the project reaches completion, the value of your tokens could rise significantly. You’ll be able to sell your tokens at a higher price, capturing returns comparable to what the developers themselves might gain.

**For NFT Holders:** NFT holders enjoy all the benefits of token holders, and more:

* **Asset Ownership:** As an NFT holder, you’ll own a specific, demarcated villa in Amna Homes. This ownership grants you complete legal rights to reside in or utilize the villa, along with access to all community amenities.  
* **Security and Peace of Mind:** Your NFT represents more than a digital asset—it is backed by legal ownership of real property. This tangible security provides confidence, as your asset is directly tied to your name.  
* **Control and Flexibility:** Whether you choose to live in, lease, or sell your Amna Homes villa, your NFT ensures you maintain direct control over your investment.

**Additional Investor Benefits(varies for project to project:**

* **Voting & Dispute Resolution:** Tokenization gives investors a voice. Through transparent voting systems, you’ll have a say in important decisions, from governance matters to operational choices. Dispute resolution is handled democratically, ensuring that each investor's interests are protected.  
* **Fair Liquidation & Distribution:** In the unlikely event of project liquidation due to unforeseen circumstances, all investors will be compensated fairly. The proceeds from any asset sales will be distributed proportionally, ensuring you receive returns that match your investment.

**Why DAO PropTech's Tokenization Model is Your Best Bet:**  
**Investing in Amna Homes through DAO PropTech** doesn’t just give you real estate ownership—it gives you **control, flexibility, and security**.
