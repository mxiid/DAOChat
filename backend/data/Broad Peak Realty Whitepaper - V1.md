# **3\. The Market Opportunity: Rawalpindi’s Growth Engine** {#3.-the-market-opportunity:-rawalpindi’s-growth-engine}

## **3.1 Market Opportunity**   {#3.1-market-opportunity}

Rawalpindi is seeing rapid growth in developmental real estate driven by urbanization and infrastructure projects like the Rawalpindi Ring Road. The city's expanding urban boundaries and rising demand for luxury residential and commercial spaces make it an attractive opportunity for early investors. Although Pakistan’s GDP growth is projected at 2%-2.5% for 2024​([Profit by Pakistan Today](https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2023/10/10/imf-projects-pakistan-gdp-to-grow-by-2-5-in-2024/))​

([Statistics Times](https://www.statisticstimes.com/economy/country/pakistan-gdp-growth.php)), real estate demand in developing areas often outpaces this, providing substantial growth potential. Broad Peak Realty taps into Rawalpindi's growing demand for sustainable and modern work spaces. The project’s strategic location and modern amenities make it a competitive offering in the market.

### **3.1 (a). Rawalpindi District Population Growth (millions)** {#3.1-(a).-rawalpindi-district-population-growth-(millions)}
 
Rawalpindi's population is expected to grow from 6.1 million in 2024 to 6.7 million by 2028\. This aligns with Pakistan's broader urbanisation trends, as more people move from rural areas to cities. As a result, the demand for working spaces is rising. Proper planning and infrastructure development in Broad Peak Realty will position the project well to meet this increasing demand.

### **3.1 (b). Key Economic Metrics (2022-2028)** {#3.1-(b).-key-economic-metrics-(2022-2028)}

| Metric | 2022 (Launch) | 2024 (Current) | 2028 (Forecast) |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Population (million)** | 6.0 | 6.1 | 6.7 |
| **Inflation Rate** | 11.5% | 12.3% | 7.5% |
| **Interest Rates** | 21% \- 22% | 17% \- 19.5% | 6% \- 10% |
| **Avg Income per Capita** | PKR 320,000 | PKR 375,000 | PKR 500,000 |

The economic outlook for Rawalpindi offers a strong case for real estate investment. With the population set to grow from 6.1 million in 2024 to 6.7 million by 2028, demand for property will rise. **Inflation is projected to drop from 12.3% to 7.5%**, and **interest rates are expected to fall from 17%-19.5% to 6%-10%**, making borrowing cheaper. As average income increases from PKR 375,000 to PKR 500,000 by 2028, purchasing power will grow, making now an **ideal time** for investors to capitalise on Rawalpindi's real estate market.

### **4.2 (a). Valuation Methods** {#4.2-(a).-valuation-methods}

**I. Comparison Method:**  
Recent sales in Bahria Town and DHA averages PKR 37,000 per sqft. Broad Peak Realty’s premium location and partnership with DaftarKhwan raises its value to **PKR 40,000 per sqft next mid year**  and approximately, with the rental increment, **PKR 45,000 per sqft by 2026\.**  
**II. Rental Evaluation Method:**  
This method estimates the asset's value based on its current rental income. It is simple yet effective in providing an accurate valuation. Understanding key terms is essential for evaluating a property’s worth.

 ROI \=Annual Rental Income Estimated Market Value  
or  
 Estimated Market Value \=Annual Rental IncomeROI

**Market Rental ROI %:** Recent analysis shows that rental ROI for a commercial space in Bahria Town is 4.2%. For Broad Peak Realty we assume that the rental ROI for such a building should be 5% to estimate conservatively. To estimate the value of a sqft, we consider rental income of PKR 1800 annually in Broad Peak Realty (PKR 150 per sqft monthly):  
**Using 5%** as Cap Rate**:** (1800/0.05 \= **PKR 36,000 / sqft**)

**III. Replacement Cost Method:**  
This method estimates the value of an asset based on the investment contributed in the creation of the asset in the present time. This is a conservative estimate to understand the underlying value of an asset.

### **4.2 (b). Forecasted Valuation of Broad Peak Realty in 2026** {#4.2-(b).-forecasted-valuation-of-broad-peak-realty-in-2026}

**I. Compounded Growth Method:**  
The Compounded Growth Evaluation Method estimates an asset's future value by applying a constant growth rate over time, based on compound interest. It is commonly used in real estate and investment analysis to project property appreciation using historical or expected growth rates in an economy.  
Key elements of this method include:

* **Inflation Rate:** Inflation refers to the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services rises. Data from PBS suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2023 has been approximately 8.5% per year in Pakistan  
* **GDP Growth Rate:** It is a broad indicator of economic health and expansion. In the context of this method, the GDP growth rate gives insight into how the overall economy is growing, influencing the expected growth rate of the asset. Data from PBS suggests that the inflation from 1990 to 2023 has been approximately 4.0% per year in Pakistan  
* **Compounded Growth Rate:** **12.5%** Inflation Rate \+ GDP Growth

**Using all methods with Compounded Growth to determine the Value in 2026\.**  
The compounded growth for 2 years would be 1.265. When applied to the valuations determined for Broad Peak Realty in 2024, this growth rate could give a glimpse of what to expect for price in 2028\.

| Valuation Method | Cost in 2024 | CGF | Value in 2026 |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| i). Comparison Method | 25,000 | 1.265 | 31,640 |
| ii). Rental Evaluation Method | 25,000 | 1.265 | 31,640 |
| iii). Replacement Cost Method | 21,406 | 1.265 | 27,100 |

## 

**II. Future Rental Evaluation Method:**

Similarly, the **rental evaluation method** assesses a property’s value based on future rental yield.

In Pakistan, rents typically increase by **10% annually** due to inflation and growing demand. This method helps investors predict future property value and potential returns, offering a clearer view of long-term profitability.

## 

The table below shows the incremental progression of rent.  

| Project | Rent (2024) | Rent (2025) | Rent (2026) |
| ----- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Grande Apartments (Phase 3\) | 1,250 | 1,375 | 1,513 |
| Safari Villas Apartments | 1,237 | 1,361 | 1,497 |
| Spring Arch | 1,300 | 1,430 | 1,573 |
| Bahria Heights (Phase 8\) | 1,200 | 1,320 | 1,452 |

**Market Rental Income:** This analysis shows that rent for a luxury mixed-use apartment building in Bahria Phase 7 would be PKR 1500 by 2026\. 

* **Using 5%** as Cap Rate**:** (1500/0.05 \= **PKR 30,000 / sqft**)

## 

## 

## **4.3 Price Forecasting and Market Trends**   {#4.3-price-forecasting-and-market-trends}

By **2026**, the token value is projected to rise to **PKR 30,000 per square foot**, driven by market demand and growth trends.

**Early-stage** investors benefit from the **greatest discounts**, as they assume higher risk during the initial phases. As the **project progresses** and risk diminishes, **discounts decrease** and token prices rise. By the time the project reaches its operational phase, the full token price is achieved, giving early investors a **significant advantage in returns** compared to those entering later.

# **6\. Investment Structure and Tokenization Model** {#6.-investment-structure-and-tokenization-model}

## **6.1 Traditional Real Estate: High Barriers, High Risk** {#6.1-traditional-real-estate:-high-barriers,-high-risk}

Historically, real estate—especially large-scale development projects—has been perceived as inaccessible to the average investor. **High capital requirements** often restrict participation to wealthy individuals or institutional investors. Additionally, **risks** such as *construction delays*, *market fluctuations*, and the **inherent illiquidity** of real estate have created a challenging landscape. *A lack of transparency* in many deals further contributes to uncertainty, leaving smaller investors hesitant to participate. As a result, **traditional real estate investment** has largely remained a **high-stakes venture** for those with substantial financial resources.

## **6.2 How Tokenization Empowers You?** {#6.2-how-tokenization-empowers-you?}

What if you could access real estate investments **without needing millions** in capital? Tokenization provides that opportunity by **fractionalizing large real estate assets** into smaller, manageable digital tokens. This innovative approach drastically **reduces the financial barrier**, enabling investors of all sizes to gain a share in *high-value projects*. **Blockchain technology** ensures *security*, *transparency*, and *complete traceability* for every participant. Beyond that, these digital tokens are **tradable**, providing a level of *liquidity* that **traditional real estate lacks**, further enhancing the appeal for all investors.

## **6.3 Developmental Real Estate: A High-Reward Opportunity** {#6.3-developmental-real-estate:-a-high-reward-opportunity}

Developmental real estate offers a unique opportunity for **exponential growth**, and now, thanks to tokenization, you can access these **lucrative projects** without the typical capital burden. **Tokenized real estate** enables *flexible investments*, granting you the potential to benefit from *capital appreciation* while enjoying enhanced *transparency* and lower risk. *Early-stage investment* in development projects not only grants **ownership** but also opens the door to **high-reward opportunities** with significantly **mitigated risks**.

## **6.4 Tokenization Framework**   {#6.4-tokenization-framework}

Through DAO PropTech’s platform, investors can purchase tokens in Broad Peak Realty. **Tokenization is a digital representation of property rights**, allowing partial ownership by converting the property into tradable digital tokens. This provides investors with an affordable and flexible way to own a portion of the property without large upfront capital.

Below is the structure of the tokenization model used for Broad Peak Realty:

### **6.4 (a). Property rights and asset classification.** {#6.4-(a).-property-rights-and-asset-classification.}

The total area of Broad Peak Realty is divided into two categories.  
**I. Demarcated:** Ownership is tied to a specific, clearly defined unit (e.g., apartment, office) within a property, offering exclusive control over that unit.  
**II. Non-Demarcated:** Ownership is partial across the entire property, without a specific unit assigned, making the asset homogeneous, flexible, and easily tradable.

To understand how ownership rights and area-holder rights are accommodated, familiarity with the following terms is essential:

| Aspect | 1). Demarcated Area | 2). Non-Demarcated Area |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Investment Size | Requires large upfront capital to purchase a full unit. | Allows smaller investments to be partially owned by purchasing tokens. |
| Liquidity | Low liquidity; the entire unit must be sold or transferred. | High liquidity; tokens can be traded like stocks on the secondary market. |
| Flexibility | Limited; tied to a specific unit, difficult to trade or divide. | Easily tradable; tokens function as homogeneous digital assets. |
| Tradability | Difficult to trade; ownership tied to physical assets and legal transfer processes. | Homogeneous and tradable like other digital assets (tokens). |
| Ownership | Ownership of a specific, clearly defined unit (e.g., apartment, hotel apartment, office). | Partial ownership of the entire property, without a specific unit. |
| Suitability | Best for those seeking long-term control and use of a specific property. | Ideal for investors seeking liquidity, flexibility, and ease of trading. |

### 

### **6.4 (b). The Asset and Token Structure :**  {#6.4-(b).-the-asset-and-token-structure-:}

**I. Definitions:**

| Attribute | Details |
| ----- | ----- |
| Token Definition | A digital representation of property rights, providing partial ownership of the property. |
| Token Representation | Each token represents 1 square foot of the building. |
| Storage | Tokens are securely stored in a central wallet. |
| Ownership Type | Partial ownership of the property. |
| Transferability | Tokens can be easily transferred or traded. |

### **6.4 (c). Tokenization Framework** {#6.4-(c).-tokenization-framework}

**I. Token-to-NFT Process Flow**

* **Token Ownership**: Investors purchase tokens representing partial ownership of the property.  
* **Conversion to NFT**: Tokens can be converted into NFTs representing specific units (e.g., apartments) once the project is completed.  
* **Burning Tokens**: Tokens are burned during conversion, removing them from circulation permanently.  
* **NFT Ownership**: NFTs grant exclusive ownership of a specific unit and can be traded or sold like traditional real estate but in a digital format.

**II. Why Burn Tokens?**

* **Prevent Duplication**: Burning the tokens ensures that they can't be used again or sold while the new NFT exists.  
* **Enforce Uniqueness**: NFTs are unique, non-fungible assets, so burning the original tokens ensures that only the NFT remains to represent the property.  
* **Preserve Integrity**: It prevents the inflation of ownership and maintains the integrity of the total asset supply.

## 

## **6.5. Token and NFT Utilities:** {#6.5.-token-and-nft-utilities:}

**Owning tokens** inBroad Peak Realty unlocks a wealth of opportunities, including:

* **Co-Ownership of Prime Real Estate:** As a token holder, you’ll own a portion of one of the most sought-after high-end properties. Even without a specific unit tied to your name, you’ll share in the success of the entire property.  
* **Profit Potential:** Once the project reaches completion, the value of your tokens could rise significantly. You’ll be able to sell your tokens at a higher price, capturing returns comparable to what the developers themselves might gain.  
* **Passive Income:** Once Broad Peak Realty is operational, you won’t just watch from the sidelines. You'll earn passive income from rental or business dividends generated by commercial activities within the property. In short, your investment doesn’t just grow—it works for you.

**For NFT Holders:** NFT holders enjoy all the benefits of token holders, and more:

* **Asset Ownership**: As an NFT holder, you’ll own a specific, demarcated area in Broad Peak Realty. This could be an apartment, office, or another unit—entirely yours. You’ll have complete ownership, with the legal rights to reside in or use the property, enjoying all the luxurious amenities.  
* **Security and Peace of Mind:** Your NFT isn’t just a digital asset—it’s backed by the legal ownership of real property. This traditional security gives you peace of mind, knowing that your asset is physically tied to your name.  
* **Security and Peace of Mind:** Whether you plan to live in Broad Peak Realty, lease it, or sell it in the future, the choice is yours. Your NFT puts you in the driver’s seat, offering direct control over your investment.

**Additional Investor Benefits:**

* **Voting & Dispute Resolution:** Tokenization gives investors a voice. Through transparent voting systems, you’ll have a say in important decisions, from governance matters to operational choices. Dispute resolution is handled democratically, ensuring that each investor's interests are protected.  
* **Fair Liquidation & Distribution:** In the unlikely event of project liquidation due to unforeseen circumstances, all investors will be compensated fairly. The proceeds from any asset sales will be distributed proportionally, ensuring you receive returns that match your investment.

**Why DAO PropTech's Tokenization Model is Your Best Bet:**  
**Investing inBroad Peak Realty through DAO PropTech** doesn’t just give you real estate ownership—it gives you **control, flexibility, and security**. Whether you’re a *token holder* or an *NFT holder*, your investment is backed by **real assets**, enhanced with *modern technology*, and designed to deliver **maximum returns**.
